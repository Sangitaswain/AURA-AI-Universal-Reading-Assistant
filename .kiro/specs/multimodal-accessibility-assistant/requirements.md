# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multimodal Accessibility Assistant is a privacy-first Chrome Extension that converts any webpage into accessible, multimodal content using Chrome Built-in AI (Gemini Nano). The extension provides image descriptions, text summaries, simplified rewrites, translations, and audio playback - all processed on-device to ensure privacy and enable offline functionality. The system targets visually impaired users, dyslexic or neurodiverse users, low-literacy readers, and users in low-bandwidth environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visually impaired user, I want to get contextual descriptions of images on web pages, so that I can understand visual content that would otherwise be inaccessible to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on an image THEN the system SHALL provide a context menu option to "Describe Image"
2. WHEN the user selects "Describe Image" THEN the system SHALL generate both alt-text (≤120 characters) and a detailed description (1-2 sentences)
3. WHEN an image description is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in the extension popup with an option to read aloud
4. WHEN the Chrome Built-in AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a friendly message explaining model availability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with dyslexia, I want to get concise summaries of long text passages, so that I can quickly understand the main points without struggling through dense content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text on a webpage THEN the system SHALL provide a context menu option to "Summarize with Accessibility Assistant"
2. WHEN the user requests a summary THEN the system SHALL generate exactly 3 concise bullet points (each ≤20 words)
3. WHEN a summary is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in the extension popup with options to read aloud and save
4. WHEN the user clicks the extension icon with text selected THEN the system SHALL show the selected text and summarization options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a low-literacy reader, I want to simplify complex text into plain English, so that I can understand content that would otherwise be too difficult to comprehend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has selected text THEN the system SHALL provide an "Explain like I'm 5" option in the popup
2. WHEN the user requests simplification THEN the system SHALL rewrite the content in plain English suitable for a 10-year-old
3. WHEN simplified text is generated THEN the system SHALL include analogies when helpful to aid understanding
4. WHEN simplification fails THEN the system SHALL show the original text with a "Try again" option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a multilingual user, I want to translate summaries and descriptions into my preferred language, so that I can access content in a language I'm more comfortable with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a summary or description is generated THEN the system SHALL provide translation options
2. WHEN the user selects a target language THEN the system SHALL translate the content using the Chrome Translator API
3. WHEN translated content is available THEN the system SHALL provide audio playback in the target language
4. IF translation fails THEN the system SHALL display the original content with an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with reading difficulties, I want to hear content read aloud, so that I can consume information through audio when text is challenging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any text content is displayed in the popup THEN the system SHALL provide a "Read Aloud" button
2. WHEN the user clicks "Read Aloud" THEN the system SHALL use browser TTS to speak the content
3. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL provide controls to pause, stop, or adjust playback
4. WHEN the browser doesn't support TTS THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate fallback message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all processing to happen on my device, so that my browsing data and content never leaves my computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension processes any content THEN the system SHALL use only Chrome Built-in AI APIs running locally
2. WHEN the AI model is not available THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to download it with clear progress indication
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL continue to work with previously downloaded models
4. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL display a clear privacy notice explaining on-device processing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user who relies on assistive technology, I want the extension to be fully keyboard accessible, so that I can use it with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates the extension popup THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via Tab key
2. WHEN using a screen reader THEN all elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and roles
3. WHEN the user presses keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+A opens popup)
4. WHEN the extension UI is displayed THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user who wants to reference content later, I want to save generated summaries and descriptions, so that I can access them again without regenerating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a "Save" option in the popup
2. WHEN the user saves content THEN the system SHALL store it in chrome.storage.local
3. WHEN the user wants to access saved content THEN the system SHALL provide a way to view and manage saved items
4. WHEN storage is full THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer or judge evaluating this extension, I want clear installation and usage instructions, so that I can easily test and understand the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is accessed THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive README with installation steps
2. WHEN loading the extension THEN the system SHALL work via Chrome's "Load unpacked" developer mode
3. WHEN testing the extension THEN all core features SHALL be demonstrable within 3 minutes
4. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL include proper documentation and comments

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user experiencing errors, I want clear feedback about what went wrong, so that I can understand the issue and potentially resolve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a clear message with instructions to enable it
2. WHEN model download fails THEN the system SHALL provide a retry option with basic diagnostics
3. WHEN AI responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL show the raw text and offer to try again
4. WHEN content script injection fails THEN the system SHALL offer an "Open in extension window" option for manual content input
