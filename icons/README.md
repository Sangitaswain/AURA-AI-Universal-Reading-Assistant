# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple accessibility-themed icons.

The icons should represent the accessibility theme of the extension, such as:
- An eye symbol for visual accessibility
- A universal access symbol
- A combination of text and image symbols
- Colors that work well in both light and dark themes

## Temporary Solution

Until proper icons are created, Chrome will use default extension icons. The extension will still function normally without custom icons.
